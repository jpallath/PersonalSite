If a user had a better idea of how to improve a movie like 'The Dark Knight Rises,' he could post his idea here and watch how the rest of the community will criticize it.  This was built on Node.js with a MongoDB database.  It utilized the Google Material Design CSS Framework for a nice polished interface.  Lastly it featured completely encrypted passwords through the use of the bcrypt node package.", "Pick Up and Go was a group effort built with the hope of making, finding, and organizing pick up games (such as basketball and soccer) into an easy experience.  My part of the project involved utilizing Facebook API to make unique user logins, develop the PostGreSql database, and many tweaks on the front end of the webpage.", "Jerrkipedia was a simple app based on mirroring the simpler parts of popular website 'Wikipedia,'.  It was my first major project utilizing Node.js and MongoDB and the first time I implemented a RESTful routing and a CRUD structure to an app."],
